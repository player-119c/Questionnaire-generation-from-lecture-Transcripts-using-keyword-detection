AI applications in healthcare
Levels of questions that can be asked from data: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive
Deep learning paradigm shift: combining feature extraction and classification into one step
Future paradigm shift for AI in healthcare: automatically learn architecture
Medical imaging: arrhythmias, ECG, holter monitor, Zeo patch
Challenges of automated ECG interpretation: single lead vs multiple leads, subtle differences between heart rhythms
Skin disease detection: segmentation, binary classification
Data augmentation: rotation, zoom, blur, translation, combination of those, stretch, symmetry
Tasks where data augmentation might hurt the model: overfitting on the test set, encoder, face detection
Importance of a well-labeled dataset
Boundary detection in segmentation
Class activation maps for visualizing why a network makes a prediction
Pipeline for autonomous driving: car detector, pedestrian detector, path cleaner
Disadvantages of a pipeline model: error localization, human-made errors in choosing components
Advantages of a pipeline model: easier data collection for sub-problems
